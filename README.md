# MayaLibrary
A simple object library for Maya 2016+

First you need to pick where your library should be under "File -> Settings" you can then create categorys and export into them with the button on the bottom right.

The folder structure looks like this
>-- Your root folder
>---- category folder
>------- object folder
>--------- object.ma

It exports the selection to a .ma file and takes a screen shot of the viewport.


# Install
1. Move the python files it into your script folders
2. Run 
```python
import Library
Library.main()
````
